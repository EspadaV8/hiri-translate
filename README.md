### How to contribute

There are three ways you can translate Hiri.

#### Weblate
The simplest and recommended approach is just to go to [Hiri project on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/translate/hiri/) and start translating. This way you can translate simultaneously with other people and the translations will automatically propagate to the main Hiri project. If you don't want to open an account on Webplate you won't be able to save translations but you can still make suggestions.

#### Qt Linguist
If you don't like the Webplate UI you can use Qt Linguist desktop application. Qt Linguist is distributed only as a part of Qt framework which is huge (a couple of GB). Luckily there is a GitHub project which has the standalone releases which you can [download here](https://github.com/thurask/Qt-Linguist/releases). In order to work with with Qt Linguist you need to have the translation file available locally on your computer.

1. Weblate:
   - You can download files from Webplate directly. Choose your language, click on 'Files' in the menu and then 'Download original translation file'.
   - Open the file in Qt Linguist and edit translations there. Save the changes.
   - Upload the translations to Webplate. Go to your language, then 'Files' -> 'Upload translation'. Webplate will automatically merge changes.
1. Git:
   - This approach isn't user friendly.
   - If you aren't already familiar with Git just forget this. If you are, you already know what to do. :wink:
   - Regular contributors will get access to the repo so they can commit directly.

#### Any text editor
You don't have to use Qt Linguist either. Qt translation files are human readable XML files, so you can edit them in any text editor. Then you can upload them to Webplate or commit changes with git. Just be careful that you properly quote special characters inside translation tags and to update type attribute from unfinished to finished.
